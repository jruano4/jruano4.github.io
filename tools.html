                <h2>What Tools Will You Need?</h2>
                <p>
                    There are a few tools that you will need to make matcha. The first tool is a bowl, this is where you will mix the matcha powder with water. The second tool is a sifter, this will help to break up any clumps in the matcha powder. The third tool is a bamboo whisk or frother, this will help to mix the matcha and water together until it is frothy. Finally, you will need a cup to pour your matcha into.

It allows you to whisk the matcha powder and water together, creating a smooth and creamy consistency.
